# fontcm

This package contains the Computer Modern font with Paul Murrell's symbol extensions, and is to be used with the extrafont package.

The fonts are a subset of the [cm-lgc font package](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/cm-lgc.html).
The faces with small caps and italics using old-style numerals (which can hang below the baseline) are not included with this package.
